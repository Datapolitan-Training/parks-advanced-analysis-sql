# Advanced Analysis with SQL

## Summary
A one-day class reinforcing the skills necessary to leverage a relational database to clean, process, and visualize NYC Parks data. The class will introduce key concepts and skills necessary to use the Structured Query Langage (SQL) for data analysis, reinforcing the problem ideation and process mapping skills taught in Introduction to Data Analysis. Working collaboratively in small groups, participants will develop an analytical question they explore throughout the class, presenting their data story at the end of class for constructive feedback.

## Target Audience
Employees of all levels of responsibility with a command of Microsoft Excel for sorting, filtering, aggregating, transforming, and visualizing data to tell a true and compelling story. Participants should have some familiarity with basic functions and how to write formulas to transform data. Participants should complete Introduction to Data Analysis prior to attending this class for an introduction to problem ideation and process mapping.

## Goals
+ Reinforce and practice key steps in exploratory data analysis
+ Demonstrate advanced techniques with SQL for data analysis
+ Reinforce brainstorming, problem ideation, and process mapping skills introduced in previous classes
+ Practice presenting true and compelling data stories to peers
+ Cultivate an attitude of curiosity to foster a culture of data-driven inquiry

## Participant Development Areas

**Conceptualizing:** Self-directed collaborative scoping of analytics problem and process

**Skill Development:** SQL for accessing, and extracting NYC Parks data for analysis

**Integrating:** Investigate context using NYC Parks resources

**Communicating:** Project pitch with content critique in order to foster an entrepreneurial mindset with respect to developing and communicating analytical work

**Language Objective:** Creatively apply the tools of data analysis to explain problems and develop potential solutions with data
