# Advanced Analysis with SQL

## Summary
A one-day class reinforcing the skills necessary to leverage a relational database to clean, process, and visualize NYC Parks data. The class will introduce key concepts and skills necessary to use the Structured Query Language (SQL) for data analysis, reinforcing the problem ideation and process mapping skills taught in Introduction to Data Analysis. Working collaboratively in small groups, participants will develop an analytical question they explore throughout the class, presenting their data story at the end of class for constructive feedback.

## Target Audience
Employees of all levels of responsibility with a command of Microsoft Excel for sorting, filtering, aggregating, transforming, and visualizing data to tell a true and compelling story, ideally through Excel for Data Analysis I and II. No familiarity with SQL is necessary for this class as we will be introducing and practicing key concepts in class. Participants should complete Introduction to Data Analysis prior to attending this class for an introduction to problem ideation and process mapping.

## Goals
+ Introduce key concepts necessary for working with relational database management systems
+ Demonstrate advanced techniques with SQL for data analysis
+ Reinforce and practice best practices in exploratory data analysis
+ Reinforce brainstorming, problem ideation, and process mapping skills introduced in previous classes
+ Practice presenting true and compelling data stories to peers
+ Cultivate an attitude of curiosity to foster a culture of data-driven inquiry

## Participant Development Areas

**Conceptualizing:** Self-directed collaborative scoping of analytics problem and process

**Skill Development:** SQL for accessing, and extracting NYC Parks data for analysis

**Integrating:** Investigate context using NYC Parks resources

**Communicating:** Project pitch with content critique in order to foster an entrepreneurial mindset with respect to developing and communicating analytical work

**Language Objective:** Creatively apply the tools of data analysis to explain problems and develop potential solutions with data

## Learning Objectives
+ Participants will be familiar with the key concepts of a relational database management system
+ Participants will be experienced in the key steps of exploratory data analysis using SQL
+ Participants will be familiar with the techniques of advanced data analysis with SQL
+ Participants will be practiced in using the techniques of brainstorming, problem ideation, and process mapping to scope and execute an analytical question
+ Participants will be practiced presenting analytical findings and describing the key steps in their analysis to their peers 
+ Participants will have an increased curiosity about how data can be leveraged for operational awareness and program success
