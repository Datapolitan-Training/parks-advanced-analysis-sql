# What is Analysis?
--

>“Analysis is simply the pursuit of understanding, usually through detailed inspection or comparison”

## - Carter Hewgley, former Director of Analytics, [Center for Government Excellence](https://govex.jhu.edu/)
???
+ Facilitator prompts participants to think about analysis in the context of their work and what it is they are trying to accomplish

# A Quick Recap from <br>Data Analysis with Excel I and II

---

# 5 Data Analytics Tasks
???
+ Facilitator introduces the 5 main tasks of analysis
+ Facilitator reminds participants we've already done the first task
+ The goal is to dispell the "black box" sense of analytics as something mystic and unknowable
--

1. Aggregating (PivotTable)
--

2. Sorting
--

3. Filtering
--

4. Manipulating
--

5. Visualizing

---

# 1. Aggregating Data 
???
+ Facilitator reminds participants we've already done this work with the available data
+ Facilitator prompts participants to think of other ways they aggregate data for insights
--

+ Trends only become clear in aggregate
--

+ Often where you discover the "so what"
--

+ Aggregating data meaningfully can be tricky
--


![img-center-70](images/311data_parks.png)

---

# 2. Sorting
???
+ Facilitator discusses briefly the value of sorting, soliciting examples from participants of when they've sorted data for their work
--

+ Reorganize rows in a dataset based on the values in a column
--

+ Can sort on multiple columns

---

# 3. Filtering
???
+ Facilitator leads brief discussion of filtering, soliciting examples from participants on applicability to their own work
--

+ Only show rows that contain some value
--

+ Can filter by multiple values
--

+ Can filter by values in multiple columns

---

# Filtering
![img-center-100](images/filter_slide83.png)
???
+ Facilitator demonstrates how to filter in Excel
---

# 4. Manipulating Data (In a good way...)
???
+ Facilitator introduces topic of manipulating (or "transforming") data 
+ Solicit feedback from participants on when they need to transform the data they work with and how they do it
--

+ Sometimes available categories don't make sense
--

+ Values may not be in the format you need (or have mistakes)
--

+ You always want to have a clean copy of the data to go back to
--

+ Best to keep track of what you've done

---

# 5. Visualizing Data
???
+ Facilitator introduces the basic concepts of why we visualize data before leading participants through an exercise to create the chart shown
--

+ Quickly communicate information
--

+ Tell a clearer story
--

+ A picture is worth a thousands words

class:center,middle
# What is a database?

---

# What is a database?
--

+ A software system that manages storing and retrieving data
--

+ The software for a database often runs on a server, not the computer you're using
--

+ There are many different database systems, today we'll be using Microsoft's SQL Server
--

+ A database stores data in *tables*

---

# Tables
--

+ How data is stored in a database
--

+ Similar to a worksheet in Excel
--

+ Organized in *rows* and *columns*
--

![img-left-50](images/table_row.png)
--

![img-right-50](images/table_column.png)

---

class:center,middle
# Let's do that again using SQL

---

# `SELECT`
--

+ How you specify which columns to get from a table
--

+ Start with `SELECT *`, which gets all the columns
--

+ Separate column names with commas (`,`)

---

# For example:

```
SELECT *
FROM tbl_DailyTasks
```
--

+ Get all of the columns from the `tbl_DailyTasks` table
--


```
SELECT date_created, created_by
FROM tbl_DailyTasks
```
--

+ Only get the `date_created` and `created_by` columns from the `tbl_DailyTasks` table
---

# `FROM`
--

+ How you specify the table you are querying
--

```
FROM tbl_DailyTasks
```

---

class:center,middle
# Why use a database?

???
+ Facilitator walks through benefits of using a database: single source of truth, always the latest data

---

# Why use a database?
--

+ Single source of truth
--

+ Don't have to worry about moving and sharing files
--

+ Can be faster and more consistent than Excel files

---

class:center,middle
# Why use SQL?

???
+ Facilitator walks through benefits of using SQL: you need to in order to communicate with a database, but also it can be self documenting: "here's the query I used" rather than "I clicked here, then there, then picked this option..." in Excel.

---

# SQL
--

+ The language databases understand
--

+ If you want to use a database, you will need at least a little SQL
--

+ It makes queries replicable&mdash;you can run the query again and be sure you will get the same results

--
+ ...and someone can use your query and be sure they will get the same results, too!

---

class:center,middle
# 15 MIN BREAK

---

# Data types
--

+ Every column in a database table has a type
--

+ A column's type determines what you can do with that column.
--

For example, you can do math on numbers but not on text.
--

+ The database will refuse to store data that doesn't match the column's type
--

+ Unless you're an administrator, you most likely will not be changing the column's type


???
+ Take a look back at data types in Excel
+ Mention that data types are more rigid in a database
+ Integers, numeric, datetime, strings

---

# Common numeric data types
--

+ `int`
--
 - a number with no digits after the decimal point, like `5` or `100349`
--

+ `numeric`
--
 - a number with digits after the decimal point, like `5.01` or `100.349`
---

# Common text data types
--

+ `varchar`
--
 - text with a maximum length, like `Queens`
--

+ `text`
--
 - text with no maximum length, like an open comment field

---

# Other common data types
--

+ `date`
--
 - a specific date, like `2002-10-17`
--

+ `datetime`
--
 - a specific date and time, like `2002-10-17 06:13:00`
--

+ Learn more in the [SQL Server documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/data-types/data-types-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017)

---

# `WHERE`
--

+ Lets you limit which *rows* are selected from the database
--
![img-center-100](images/filter_slide83.png)
--

+ You define a condition that is either true or false, and every row is evaluated using that

--

???
+ Look back at filters in Excel
+ Do something similar in a WHERE
+ `AND` and `OR`
+ Watch out for precedence with `AND` and `OR`
+ `NULL` vs empty strings

---

# `WHERE`

```
SELECT *
FROM tbl_DailyTasks
WHERE graffiti = 1
```
--

+ Select the daily tasks rows where graffiti was present

---

# `WHERE`

```
SELECT *
FROM tbl_DailyTasks
WHERE nhours &gt; 1
```
--

+ Select the daily tasks rows where nhours is greater than 1

---

# `WHERE` operators

+ `=`
--
 - equal to
--

+ `&gt;`
--
 - greater than
--

+ `&gt;=`
--
 - greater than or equal to
--

+ `&lt;`
--
 - less than
--

+ `&lt;=`
--
 - less than or equal to
--

+ `!=`
--
 and `&lt;&gt;`
--
 - not equal to
--

+ Learn more in [the SQL Server documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/comparison-operators-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017)

---

# Your Turn

+ Create an SQL query with a `WHERE` clause
+ Continue using the `tbl_DailyTasks` table
+ Try writing a condition on a numeric column
+ If you have time, try writing a condition on a text column

---

class:center,middle
# What if you want to combine conditions?

---

# `WHERE`

```
SELECT *
FROM tbl_DailyTasks
WHERE graffiti = 1 AND nhours &gt; 1
```
--

+ Select the daily tasks rows where graffiti was present *and* the number of hours taken was over 1

---

# `WHERE`

```
SELECT *
FROM tbl_DailyTasks
WHERE omppropid = 'X045-01' OR omppropid = 'X045-02'
```
--

+ Select the daily tasks rows for `omppropid` equal to either `X045-01` or `X045-02`

---

# `WHERE`

```
SELECT *
FROM tbl_DailyTasks
WHERE NOT (omppropid = 'X045-01' OR omppropid = 'X045-02')
```
--

+ What do you think this does?
--

+ Why would we use parentheses here?

---

# Your Turn

+ Create an SQL query with a `WHERE` clause
+ Continue using the `tbl_DailyTasks` table
+ Start with one condition, then try adding conditions using `AND` / `OR`

---

# Formulas
--

+ You can do arithmetic and combine values in the ways you're used to in Excel
--

+ You can also get a modified version of a value

???
+ Take a look back at arithmetic in Excel
+ You can do arithmetic in SQL, too
+ Order of operations is similar, using parentheses as needed
+ Show equivalent in SQL to something relatively complicated in Excel
+ Introduce `AS` for setting the output column name

---

# Using formulas with numbers
--

+ You can use the usual mathematical operators here:
  `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`
--

+ For example, you can multiply a column by a number
--

+ `nhours * 60`
--

would find the number of minutes
--

```
SELECT nhours * 60
FROM tbl_DailyTasks
```

---

# Using functions with change text
--

+ Remember the `LEFT` function in Excel?
--

![img-center-80](images/leftfunctionaction.png)
--

+ It extracts part of a cell's value

---

# Using functions with text
--

+ We can do the same thing with SQL
--

+ `LEFT` extracts part of a string
--

+ The format is `LEFT(column, length)`
--

+ `LEFT(propid, 1)` would select the first letter from the `propid` column

--
```
SELECT LEFT(propid, 1)
FROM tbl_DailyTasks
```

--

+ Find more functions in the [SQL Server Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/string-functions-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017)

---

# Your Turn

+ Look at the documentation for [mathematical functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/mathematical-functions-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017) and [string functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/functions/string-functions-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017)
+ Write an SQL query that uses one of the functions that you found

---

# Aggregation
--

+ You often don't want or need every single row from a database
--

+ For example, if you want to count all of the rows matching some condition you don't want to load all of them in Excel, then count them
--

+ When you can, *make the database do the work*

???
+ Look back at COUNTIF/SUMIF pivot tables in Excel
+ Do something similar using a combination of GROUP BY and WHERE

---

# Aggregation example
--

+ Remember pivot tables from Excel?
--

+ ...and `COUNTIF` and `SUMIF` from Excel?
--

![img-center-80](images/countiffunctionaction.png)
--

+ We're going to work through something similar using SQL

---

# `GROUP BY`
--

+ You can add `GROUP BY` after a `WHERE` in a query to group by a certain column
--

+ For example if you want to summarize data by `sector`, then you would use `GROUP BY sector`

---

# Aggregation functions
--

+ `GROUP BY` isn't useful by itself
--

+ You will usually want to aggregate some other columns
--

+ Aggregation functions let you do this

---

# Aggregation functions
--

+ `COUNT`
--
 - count the number of values, usually used as `COUNT(*)`
--

+ `SUM`
--
 - sum the values, for example `SUM(nhours)`
--

+ `AVG`
--
 - average the values, such as `AVG(nhours)`
--

+ `MIN`
--
 - find the smallest value, such as `MIN(nhours)`
--

+ `MAX`
--
 - find the largest value, such as `MAX(nhours)`
--

---

# Aggregation functions
--

+ Putting it all together, we can use `SUM(nhours)` and `GROUP BY sector`
--

```
SELECT sector, SUM(nhours)
FROM tbl_DailyTasks
GROUP BY sector
```

--

+ You usually want to include the column you grouped by in the `SELECT` so you can see which group is being talked about

---

# Your Turn

+ Aggregate the data again
+ Use the `tbl_DailyTasks` table
+ In your SQL, you should use `GROUP BY` and one of the aggregation functions on the previous slide
+ Feel free to experiment

+ `SELECT`
--
 - picks columns from your table
--

+ `FROM`
--
 - picks a table
--

+ `WHERE`
--
 - decides which rows are selected
--

+ `GROUP BY`
--
 - aggregates data based on a column

# Then you might need a *join*

---

# Joins
--

+ Allow you to bring in columns from mulitple database tables at once
--

+ Require some common column between the tables in order to determine which values are associated with which
--

+ Are a little tricky to write
--
...but are very powerful

---

# 15 MIN BREAK

---

# Final Exercise
--

+ Consider the SQL we just talked about
--

+ Think about some questions you could ask of the PIP and Daily Tasks data (or some other database tables you have access to)
--

+ Think about data visualizations you could do to answer the questions

---

# Final Exercise
--

+ Create a new Excel workbook
--

+ Create a worksheet in the workbook that will contain your documentation
--

+ Try to write SQL queries for each of the questions that you established earlier, making a new worksheet for each
--

+ Make a data visualization with at least one of these worksheets

+ Introduction to SQL
--

+ Using SQL in Excel to gather and analyze data
--

+ Did we miss anything?

---

# Optimizing queries
--

+ What if you try to load data and it takes too long?
--

+ Try to minimize the number of *rows* and *columns* you are pulling out of the database
--

+ Remember you can use `SELECT` to limit the columns
--

+ And you can use `WHERE` to limit the rows
--

+ If you only need a summary of the data, consider using aggregation (`GROUP BY`)

???
+ Sometimes you can write inefficient queries
+ Common pitfalls, how to recognize a slow query
+ Common ways to speed things up (such only selecting what you need to select)
